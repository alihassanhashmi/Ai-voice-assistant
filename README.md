💡 How It Works
1. Voice Interaction Flow
•	User clicks "Start" and speaks their request
•	AI processes speech and categorizes into 4 options
•	System guides user through conversational workflow
•	Backend processes requests and updates database
2. Order Management
•	Collects customer name and phone number
•	Handles multi-item orders with quantity tracking
•	Generates unique order numbers
•	Enforces 5-minute cancellation policy
3. AI Knowledge Base
•	Upload restaurant menus, policies, FAQs as PDF/TXT/DOCX
•	Automatic document chunking and embedding
•	Vector similarity search for relevant responses
•	Continuous learning from new documents
